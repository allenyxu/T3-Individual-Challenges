## Bubble Sort
- Swaps adajcent elements into the correct order
- Whole pass is then performed to ensure that the array is fully sorted, and the algorithm knows to stop
- Time Complexity/ Big O Notation: Bubble sort can vary in its Big O Notation, with a worst case scenario of O(n^2) and a best case scenario of O(n)
- Example of the pure algorithm
``` class BubbleSort
{
    void bubbleSort(int arr[])
    {
        int n = arr.length;
        for (int i = 0; i < n-1; i++)
            for (int j = 0; j < n-i-1; j++)
                if (arr[j] > arr[j+1])
                {
                    // swap arr[j+1] and arr[j]
                    int temp = arr[j];
                    arr[j] = arr[j+1];
                    arr[j+1] = temp;
                }
    }
 
    /* Prints the array */
    void printArray(int arr[])
    {
        int n = arr.length;
        for (int i=0; i<n; ++i)
            System.out.print(arr[i] + " ");
        System.out.println();
    }
 
    // Driver method to test above
    public static void main(String args[])
    {
        BubbleSort ob = new BubbleSort();
        int arr[] = {64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90};
        ob.bubbleSort(arr);
        System.out.println("Sorted array");
        ob.printArray(arr);
    }
} 
```

### Implementation

## Selection Sort
- Finds the minimun value element repeadly in an ascending pattern
- Essentially has 2 arrays, in which the minimun value is then added to a sorted array, while algorithm finds the next minimun value in the unsorted array
- Time Complexity Formula/ Big O Notation: O(n^2) is the notation because selection sort utilizes 2 arrays
- ![Flowchart](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/cdn-uploads/20220203094305/Selection-Sort-Flowhchart.png)
- Example algorithm of a selection sort:
``` 
class SelectionSort
{
    void sort(int arr[])
    {
        int n = arr.length;
  
        // One by one move boundary of unsorted subarray
        for (int i = 0; i < n-1; i++)
        {
            // Find the minimum element in unsorted array
            int min_idx = i;
            for (int j = i+1; j < n; j++)
                if (arr[j] < arr[min_idx])
                    min_idx = j;
  
            // Swap the found minimum element with the first
            // element
            int temp = arr[min_idx];
            arr[min_idx] = arr[i];
            arr[i] = temp;
        }
    }
  
    // Prints the array
    void printArray(int arr[])
    {
        int n = arr.length;
        for (int i=0; i<n; ++i)
            System.out.print(arr[i]+" ");
        System.out.println();
    }
  
    // Driver code to test above
    public static void main(String args[])
    {
        SelectionSort ob = new SelectionSort();
        int arr[] = {64,25,12,22,11};
        ob.sort(arr);
        System.out.println("Sorted array");
        ob.printArray(arr);
    }
}
```

## Linked Lists

- As stated, most "Data Structures" conversations usually begin with Arrays
>- Is built into most Computer Programming Languages 
- College Board has Units 6-8 which discuss Arrays, ArrayLists, and 2-Dimensional Arrays
- Most Data Structures conversations continue with the discussions of Linked Lists which are the foundation for Stacks and Queues

## Data Structures

- A data structure is a method of organizing data
- Think of a variable holding a single integer value(ex: int n=4;) or sequences of numbers(ex: int[] numbers=new int[]{ 1,2,3 };) or tables of data, or databases: these are all well-defined data structures. 
- Data Structures and organizing data will require students to become more algorithmic in coding.

## Data Structure Algorithms
- There are many algorithms for different purposes and they interact with different data structures. 
- Think of algorithms as dynamic underlying pieces that interact with data structures. 
- EX:
```
public void swapToLowHighOrder(IntByReference i) {
        if (this.value > i.value) {
            int temp = this.value;
            this.value = i.value;
            i.value = temp;
        }
    }
```
- Together, data structures and algorithms combine and allow programmers to build whatever computer programs theyâ€™d like. 
- Good managed data structures and algorithms ensures well-optimized and efficient code.
## Paradigms
#### Imperative Paradigms
- An imperative program consists of commands for the computer to perform to achieve a result. Imperative programming focuses on describing "how" a program code works.
#### OO Paradigm
- OOP models complex things as reproducible, simple structures. 
- Reusable, OOP classes can be used across programs by simply making an object. 
- We have learned about many key aspects of OOP.
- OO based matrix alteration
```
public String reverse() {
        // outer loop starting at end row
        StringBuilder output = new StringBuilder();
        for (int i = matrix.length;  0 < i; i--) {
            // inner loop for column
            for (int j =  matrix[i-1].length; 0 < j; j--) {
                output.append((matrix[i-1][j-1]==-1) ? " " : String.format("%x",matrix[i-1][j-1])).append(" ");
            }
            output.append("\n"); // new line
        }
        return output.toString();
    }
```
