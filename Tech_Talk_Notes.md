## Bubble Sort
- Swaps adajcent elements into the correct order
- Whole pass is then performed to ensure that the array is fully sorted, and the algorithm knows to stop
- **Time Complexity/ Big O Notation:** Bubble sort can vary in its Big O Notation, with a worst case scenario of O(n^2) and a best case scenario of O(n)
- Code which we built off of in the implementation process
``` class BubbleSort
{
    void bubbleSort(int arr[])
    {
        int n = arr.length;
        for (int i = 0; i < n-1; i++)
            for (int j = 0; j < n-i-1; j++)
                if (arr[j] > arr[j+1])
                {
                    // swap arr[j+1] and arr[j]
                    int temp = arr[j];
                    arr[j] = arr[j+1];
                    arr[j+1] = temp;
                }
    }
 
    /* Prints the array */
    void printArray(int arr[])
    {
        int n = arr.length;
        for (int i=0; i<n; ++i)
            System.out.print(arr[i] + " ");
        System.out.println();
    }
 
    // Driver method to test above
    public static void main(String args[])
    {
        BubbleSort ob = new BubbleSort();
        int arr[] = {64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90};
        ob.bubbleSort(arr);
        System.out.println("Sorted array");
        ob.printArray(arr);
    }
} 
```

### Implementation

## Selection Sort
- Finds the minimun value element repeadly in an ascending pattern
- Essentially has 2 arrays, in which the minimun value is then added to a sorted array, while algorithm finds the next minimun value in the unsorted array
- **Time Complexity Formula/ Big O Notation:** O(n^2) is the notation because selection sort utilizes 2 arrays

![Flowchart](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/cdn-uploads/20220203094305/Selection-Sort-Flowhchart.png)
- Example algorithm of a selection sort which we built off of and implemented:
``` 
class SelectionSort
{
    void sort(int arr[])
    {
        int n = arr.length;
  
        // One by one move boundary of unsorted subarray
        for (int i = 0; i < n-1; i++)
        {
            // Find the minimum element in unsorted array
            int min_idx = i;
            for (int j = i+1; j < n; j++)
                if (arr[j] < arr[min_idx])
                    min_idx = j;
  
            // Swap the found minimum element with the first
            // element
            int temp = arr[min_idx];
            arr[min_idx] = arr[i];
            arr[i] = temp;
        }
    }
  
    // Prints the array
    void printArray(int arr[])
    {
        int n = arr.length;
        for (int i=0; i<n; ++i)
            System.out.print(arr[i]+" ");
        System.out.println();
    }
  
    // Driver code to test above
    public static void main(String args[])
    {
        SelectionSort ob = new SelectionSort();
        int arr[] = {64,25,12,22,11};
        ob.sort(arr);
        System.out.println("Sorted array");
        ob.printArray(arr);
    }
}
```
### Implementation

## Merge Sort
- Merge Sort is a divide and conquer type of algorithm
- Input array is divided into 2 halves, calls each half, and then merges the halves back together
>- Merge is the key process and is executed after the halves are sorted
- **Time Complexity/Big O Notation:** O(n * Log (n)) Because this is a logarithmic function, it means that the time taken based on the amount of elements isn't as affected, and is a rather efficent program. Even in a worst case scenario, the notation still reamins the same

![Flowchart](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/cdn-uploads/Merge-Sort-Tutorial.png)
- Sample algorithm which we built off to try and implement
```
class MergeSort 
{
    // Merges two subarrays of arr[].
    // First subarray is arr[l..m]
    // Second subarray is arr[m+1..r]
    void merge(int arr[], int l, int m, int r)
    {
        // Find sizes of two subarrays to be merged
        int n1 = m - l + 1;
        int n2 = r - m;
  
        /* Create temp arrays */
        int L[] = new int[n1];
        int R[] = new int[n2];
  
        /*Copy data to temp arrays*/
        for (int i = 0; i < n1; ++i)
            L[i] = arr[l + i];
        for (int j = 0; j < n2; ++j)
            R[j] = arr[m + 1 + j];
  
        /* Merge the temp arrays */
  
        // Initial indexes of first and second subarrays
        int i = 0, j = 0;
  
        // Initial index of merged subarray array
        int k = l;
        while (i < n1 && j < n2) {
            if (L[i] <= R[j]) {
                arr[k] = L[i];
                i++;
            }
            else {
                arr[k] = R[j];
                j++;
            }
            k++;
        }
  
        /* Copy remaining elements of L[] if any */
        while (i < n1) {
            arr[k] = L[i];
            i++;
            k++;
        }
  
        /* Copy remaining elements of R[] if any */
        while (j < n2) {
            arr[k] = R[j];
            j++;
            k++;
        }
    }
  
    // Main function that sorts arr[l..r] using
    // merge()
    void sort(int arr[], int l, int r)
    {
        if (l < r) {
            // Find the middle point
            int m =l+ (r-l)/2;
  
            // Sort first and second halves
            sort(arr, l, m);
            sort(arr, m + 1, r);
  
            // Merge the sorted halves
            merge(arr, l, m, r);
        }
    }
  
    /* A utility function to print array of size n */
    static void printArray(int arr[])
    {
        int n = arr.length;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
            System.out.print(arr[i] + " ");
        System.out.println();
    }
  
    // Driver code
    public static void main(String args[])
    {
        int arr[] = { 12, 11, 13, 5, 6, 7 };
  
        System.out.println("Given Array");
        printArray(arr);
  
        MergeSort ob = new MergeSort();
        ob.sort(arr, 0, arr.length - 1);
  
        System.out.println("\nSorted array");
        printArray(arr);
    }
}

# Tech Talk 1

## Linked Lists

- As stated, most "Data Structures" conversations usually begin with Arrays
>- Is built into most Computer Programming Languages 
- College Board has Units 6-8 which discuss Arrays, ArrayLists, and 2-Dimensional Arrays
- Most Data Structures conversations continue with the discussions of Linked Lists which are the foundation for Stacks and Queues

## Data Structures

- A data structure is a method of organizing data
- Think of a variable holding a single integer value(ex: int n=4;) or sequences of numbers(ex: int[] numbers=new int[]{ 1,2,3 };) or tables of data, or databases: these are all well-defined data structures. 
- Data Structures and organizing data will require students to become more algorithmic in coding.

## Data Structure Algorithms
- There are many algorithms for different purposes and they interact with different data structures. 
- Think of algorithms as dynamic underlying pieces that interact with data structures. 
- EX:
```
public void swapToLowHighOrder(IntByReference i) {
        if (this.value > i.value) {
            int temp = this.value;
            this.value = i.value;
            i.value = temp;
        }
    }
```
- Together, data structures and algorithms combine and allow programmers to build whatever computer programs theyâ€™d like. 
- Good managed data structures and algorithms ensures well-optimized and efficient code.
## Paradigms
#### Imperative Paradigms
- An imperative program consists of commands for the computer to perform to achieve a result. Imperative programming focuses on describing "how" a program code works.
#### OO Paradigm
- OOP models complex things as reproducible, simple structures. 
- Reusable, OOP classes can be used across programs by simply making an object. 
- We have learned about many key aspects of OOP.
- OO based matrix alteration
```
public String reverse() {
        // outer loop starting at end row
        StringBuilder output = new StringBuilder();
        for (int i = matrix.length;  0 < i; i--) {
            // inner loop for column
            for (int j =  matrix[i-1].length; 0 < j; j--) {
                output.append((matrix[i-1][j-1]==-1) ? " " : String.format("%x",matrix[i-1][j-1])).append(" ");
            }
            output.append("\n"); // new line
        }
        return output.toString();
    }
```
