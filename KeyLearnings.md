## Week 3 Learnings
- One big takeaway I had from week 3 was Big O Notation
>- I learned how to evaluate the efficency based on the Big O Notation, mainly through visuallizing the graph
- The challenge also taught me the 4 different kind of sorts that we needed to implement
>- Bubble sort involved swapping 2 terms, and is rather inefficent
>- Merge sort involves the splitting and merging of an array, is very efficent
>- Selection Sort reolves around a sorted and unsorted array
>- Insertion sort compares backwards, puttting smaller terms in the front of the array each time

## Week 2 Learnings
- In the week 2 challenge a key learning I had was about RPN
>- I learned that this was a method of computing that is for computers
>- Was used a while back as a form of calculating, but has now evolved to be more user friendly
- I also learned about "splitting" which tokenizes each element of a list
>- Makes performing the calculator function that was inputted as a string possible
>- **PBL Connection:** Can be implemented to PBL as well since the user input is a string, so if I want to perform a sort of algorithm with the input I can use this split function

## Week 1 Learnings
- Week 1 I learned about Linked Lists, a form of arrays
>- Linked lists work by linking the previous and the next element of an array together
- I also learned about the importance of and methods to adding and deleting from a queue
>- pull() and add() are forms of altering a queue and changing the elements
>- Allows you to modify output and create patterns or sort for specific data
